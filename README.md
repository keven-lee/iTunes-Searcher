iTunes Searcher
=================================================================
An iTunes store search app for various media by using the iTunes API. Built with AngularJS and PhoneGap to create a hybrid mobile app.

- Search for songs, videos, and audio books using the app and instantly preview them in the app
- Display icons, splash screens, preferences, and plugins in the config.xml for iOS and Android


## Purpose

The native iTunes store webpage is cluttered and does not provide an in depth detail on their products. The items are not filtered efficiently, and the user is required to download iTunes in order to view more details on their digital products.

* Simple interface, with a home button on the top right to direct the user back to the home page
